# Re-inventing prefabricated components a.k.a Refab

In my dev life I've started a lot of projects. Every time at the beginning I have a lot of passion
and after a few weeks I start to lose my interest and eventually I quit those projects unfinished. 

Each time I start a new project I have to do some stuff that I've already done in my previous project.
I need to create the project directories architecture, I need to create authentication APIs and screens (I've 
literally build a thousand login screens in my life, and honestly I hate it), or all this common stuff 
that each project have.

To do this repetitive stuff over and over again for each new project, increases the inertia to start 
the project at all.

So people like me who wants to create a prototype or an MVP out of their ideas real quick, need to be
armed with something that enables them to overcome this boring stuff.

## TLDR;

My solution to this is Refab! Refab is going to be that magical CLI tool that does the boring stuff for you,
you just do this:

```bash
refab generate page register
```

and Refab goes:

```bash
  ⚙️ Creating Register page in /src/pages/register/ ...
```

and voila...
```bash
  🎉 Register page created!

  Files added:
  - 📄 /src/pages/register/index.tsx
  - 📄 /src/pages/register/index.styled.tsx

  Packages added:
  - 📦 @mantine/forms
```

and that's it! Refab automatically creates a register folder inside your pages directory containing a clean register
screen that you can start modifying it and connect it to your components. Also it install all the dependencies that register
screen needs and also added other files and components that were imported in register screen! Awesome, Ha?

## So why bother? Why just not copy/pasting?

I've been there, and I'm pretty sure that you've been there too. It just never worth the time to copy and paste shit,
from our old nasty projects! 

Here's why I prefer not to do it:

### Clean-up takes a while

When you copy a code from an old codebase, you need to delete a lot of stuff, change some others and try to install all 
the missing dependencies. You have to change the styles and get rid of those old ones. 
And you probably need to go line by line to make sure there's nothing that you don't want. 

### I myself hate my old codes

You know it. Our old codes are always bad. Most of the time is hard to look at it. So using it again? Oh no, thanks. I
just prefer to spend sometime and do it the right way!

### It's just not easy, right?

Help me out here. Those who know what I'm talking about know that it's not easy, and it's not likable. So I wrap up my reasons here! 


## So what next?

Right now, I'm building Refab with the help of a friend of mine and it's in the development phase. 
I'm expecting to release Refab in a couple of months but we have to see, as I have a full-time job.

You can follow Refab's progress in it's <a href="https://github.com/refab-js" target="_blank">github organization</a>.

In the next devlog, I'll try to write Refab's roadmap.

Thanks for the reading, I'll see you tomorrow, hopefully.
