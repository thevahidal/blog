# Ben Franklin once said...

Yeah, so I wanted to start this blog last night, but because I'm lazy and I couldn't find a 
nice Next.js blog template, I postponed to today.

Today, I jumped off of my perfectionism horse and started with this minimal (though super awesome) starter 
template from Next.js templates.

Anyways the goal is to post daily, hoping that I find something interesting here. I don't wanna lie,
I like writing but in my opinion to write a blog post, you have to write with a goal and what you write,
eventually must have a meaning.

But you know, well, "That's just, like, my opinion", man! Then screw it. 

import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/images/posts/1/big-lebowski.gif"
  alt="big lebowski"
  width={1125}
  height={400}
  objectFit="contain"
  priority
/>

Quality is like the enemy of Quantity, so I try to write consistently but without any sort of defined Quality!

Anyways, this is number one, so stay tuned for others to come.


And if you're curious about the title of this post, it's totally unrelated to it, as you might already guess. 

I just saw a Ben Franklin quote today in Linkedin, and I really liked it, so here's the take-way from this post.

> Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn. – Benjamin Franklin (Obviously)

So I kinda feel it's a little bit odd to finish with this quote, but that's what it is. Get the hell out.
